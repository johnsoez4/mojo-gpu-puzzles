# Task List - Mojo GPU Puzzles P04 Implementation

## Overview
This task list tracks the progress of creating a CPU-only implementation of the `add_10_2d()` function and comprehensive benchmark script for comparing three different implementations.

## Tasks

### âœ… Create CPU-only implementation of add_10_2d function
**Status:** Complete  
**Description:** Create p04_cpu.mojo with a CPU-only version of add_10_2d() that replicates the exact calculation logic from the GPU implementations but runs entirely on CPU without GPU operations

**Completed Work:**
- Created `solutions/p04/p04_cpu.mojo` with CPU-only implementation
- Used `UnsafePointer` for memory management to match GPU implementations
- Implemented nested CPU loops to replicate GPU kernel logic
- Added test data creation and result verification functions

### âœ… Create comprehensive benchmark script
**Status:** Complete  
**Description:** Create a benchmark script that measures and compares execution time of all three add_10_2d() implementations (CPU-only, p04.mojo, p04_layout_tensor.mojo) using identical test data and multiple test runs

**Completed Work:**
- Created `solutions/p04/benchmark_add_10_2d.mojo` with comprehensive benchmarking
- Implemented timing measurements using `perf_counter_ns()` for high precision
- Added `BenchmarkResult` struct for organizing results
- Included benchmarking functions for all three implementations:
  - CPU implementation
  - GPU UnsafePointer implementation  
  - GPU LayoutTensor implementation
- Added result verification and performance comparison with speedup calculations

### ðŸ”„ Test and validate implementations
**Status:** In Progress  
**Description:** Run the benchmark script to verify that all three implementations produce identical numerical results and measure their relative performance

**Current Issue:**
- Mojo environment has fundamental configuration problems
- Compiler cannot locate basic modules: `stdlib`, `memory`, `testing`, `gpu`, `time`, `layout`
- Basic types not recognized: `Int`, `Bool`, `String`, `DType`, `UnsafePointer`
- Issue persists even with `pixi shell` activated and running from repository root
- Same errors occur with existing repository examples, indicating systemic environment problem

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate Mojo environment configuration requirements beyond `pixi shell`
- Check if additional environment variables or setup steps are needed
- Once environment is fixed, run benchmark script to validate implementations
- Verify numerical accuracy across all three implementations
- Measure and compare performance metrics

## Files Created

### `solutions/p04/p04_cpu.mojo`
CPU-only implementation with:
- `add_10_2d_cpu()` function using nested loops
- `UnsafePointer` memory management
- Test data creation and verification functions
- Main test function for standalone execution

### `solutions/p04/benchmark_add_10_2d.mojo`
Comprehensive benchmark script with:
- High-precision timing using `perf_counter_ns()`
- `BenchmarkResult` struct for result organization
- Benchmark functions for all three implementations
- Performance comparison and speedup calculations
- Result verification to ensure numerical accuracy

## Technical Details

### CPU Implementation Logic
```mojo
fn add_10_2d_cpu(
    output: UnsafePointer[Scalar[dtype]],
    a: UnsafePointer[Scalar[dtype]],
    size: Int,
):
    for row in range(size):
        for col in range(size):
            var index = row * size + col
            output[index] = a[index] + 10.0
```

### Benchmark Configuration
- Matrix size: 2x2 (configurable via `SIZE` alias)
- Number of benchmark runs: 10 (configurable via `NUM_BENCHMARK_RUNS`)
- GPU configuration: 1 block per grid, (3,3) threads per block
- Data type: `DType.float32`

## Environment Requirements
- Mojo compiler with MAX Engine support
- GPU-capable environment for GPU implementations
- Pixi package manager for dependency management
- Access to Mojo standard library modules

## Current Status
The implementation work is complete, but testing is blocked by Mojo environment configuration issues that prevent execution of any Mojo code, including existing repository examples.
